# esp32_bleutoothusb_gps
 gps on esp32-wroom
made on esp32-wroom with gps module for my astro box.
gps is read on rx-tx serial by the esp32
then the data is sent to bleutooth to fetch it on a raspberry pi.
also send data on usb serial to get it on windows with franson gps gate.
data is in raw version so need gate on windows to read.
